# ColorFlux a.k.a. SpectralBeat
A web app built with react, redux, WebAudio, getUserMedia and TypeScript.
It analyzes the audio signal of your microphone and shows pretty colors :-)

## RoadMap:
- replace ScriptProcessor with AudioWorker
- support as Progressive Web App
- UI/UX improvements
- a more elaborate visualization
- Equalizer for input signal
- parameters controllable by MIDI

PRs welcome, pls get in touch!
